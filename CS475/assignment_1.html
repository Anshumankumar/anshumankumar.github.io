            <h3> Assigment 1</h3>
        </center>
        <p align=justify>This page describes about the first assigment of computer Graphics. The code has been tested on GL Version: 4.5.0 NVIDIA 352.30. 
        </p>
        <p align=justify>
        It starts from main.cpp. It creates a window of size 640 x640.
        It consist of gl_framework.cpp and gl_framework.hpp that handles
        the mouse, keybord and error. The 'assign1_vshader.glsl' is the
        vertex shader file. It handles the rotation of the images. There
        is also one fragment shader that just return whatever input it
        gets without modification. These shader file are managed by
        shader_util.cpp.  
        </p>

        <p align=justify>
        The main thing handling all the thing is object.cpp. It does 
        work from drawing on screen, creating tranformation matrix to 
        reading and saving to and from files.
        </p>   

        <p align=justify>
        The objects are read from .raw files. The raw are are generated
        from .cpp files. Below I have shown all the rendered images.
